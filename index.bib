  abstract  = "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in (supervised)
               learning with graph data, especially using graph neural networks.
               However, the development of meaningful benchmark datasets and
               standardized evaluation procedures is lagging, consequently
               hindering advancements in this area. To address this, we
               introduce the TUDataset for graph classification and regression.
               The collection consists of over 120 datasets of varying sizes
               from a wide range of applications. We provide Python-based data
               loaders, kernel and graph neural network baseline
               implementations, and evaluation tools. Here, we give an overview
               of the datasets, standardized evaluation procedures, and provide
               baseline experiments. All datasets are available at
               www.graphlearning.io. The experiments are fully reproducible from
               the code available at www.github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset.",
